# Selenium Web Scraping Project

This project is a simple web scraper built using Selenium. It is designed to extract store names, 
addresses, and phone numbers from a website.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to automate the process of collecting store information from a specific 
website [Scanteak Taiwan website](https://www.scanteak.com.tw/our-stores/). The script uses Selenium 
to navigate through the website, locate the relevant information, 
and extract it for further use.

### Features

- Store Name: The script identifies and extracts the names of the stores listed on the website.
- Address: The script extracts the addresses associated with each store.
- Phone Number: The script retrieves the phone numbers listed for each store.
